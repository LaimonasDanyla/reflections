How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Diff outcome shows + and - signs - i.e. changes in the new version. It allows to
    concentrate attention to only + (added) or -(removed) and it is much
    quicker to spot a bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    From the first version of the file you can see the starting base and all
    the changes done to the code or file later on. If e.g. you make a bug you
    go back to the latest version which was working, or undo the errors in code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros of manual commits:
      -You do you after one logical change
      -Allows you to commit at certain time and phase when needed, to create
      logical blocks of changes in a code
      - allows commenting on every commit to track what has been done.
    Cons of manual commits:
      -extra work.
    Pros of automatically saved versions:
      - saves time
      - have a backup
    Cons of automatically saved versions:
      - if saved in the middle of the process - will be hard to follow up
      - no comments (??) are possible for saved versions
      - it would make harder take too much time to assemble the right code



Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It is very important feature to commit multiple files: a change in one file
    can have related changes in another file or files, whether automatically or
    manually. So one commit would allow to see changes in all related submitted
    files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    With git log we can see all commits (versions) and find comments that are
    of interest. When needed commit is found, using git diff we can compare
    needed versions of files by typing in git bash $ git diff following
    the ID ID of commits. Diff outcome clearly shows added (+ green) and
    removed lines (red -) and what remains unchanged (black).

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It is possible to get back to the last version till all was working as
    intended: by checking recent working commits, comparing them and spotting
    changes in each quickly. So it is possible to take extra risk and trials
    on code and program functionality.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I will use Git for version control of my code.
